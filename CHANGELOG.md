## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Commit files view
- TUI: `l` on the Commits panel shows the selected commit's changed files as
  a directory-grouped tree in the left column (replacing the three left
  panels while open). Follow-live: j/k keeps moving through commits and the
  tree reloads for each one. `/` searches file paths, ctrl+↑/↓ / pgup/pgdn /
  mouse wheel scroll, esc/`l` close. Merge commits show their first-parent
  diff; renames render as `R old → new`.

#### Contextual footer
- TUI: the footer now shows only the keys that work right now — panel/row
  specific actions first (`[s]witch` hides on the checked-out branch,
  `[enter] switch`/`[d]elete` hide on the current worktree, the `m` hint
  reads mark/unmark/pair to match the mark state), then the global tail.
  While an operation runs it collapses to `[tab] [?] [q]`; filter input
  shows its own line. Availability predicates are shared between the key
  dispatch and the footer, so a shown key always works — and `s`/`d` on the
  checked-out branch or `d` on the current worktree are now clean no-ops
  instead of operations git rejects.

#### Mark-and-pair operations + SmartMerge
- TUI: `m` marks a row; `m` on a second row of the same panel opens a
  pair-operation picker (generic per-panel registry). Branches offer
  **Merge** (worktree-aware SmartMerge: merges in place, in the worktree
  that has the target checked out, or autostash+switch+stay) and a
  disabled Rebase placeholder. `esc` clears the mark before the filter.
- CLI: `gg merge [--into <target>] [--on-conflict=keep|abort] <source>`.
  New `merge-conflict` decision (`keep-conflicts`/`abort`) shared across
  frontends. Embedded using-gg agent skill v5.

#### Help window
- **Help window**: `?` opens a searchable list of every key binding, grouped
  by context. `/` searches (panel-consistent); ↑/↓ or j/k, ctrl+↑/↓,
  pgup/pgdn, and the mouse wheel scroll; `q`/esc close. Built on a new generic read-only content popup (`contentPopup`)
  reusable for future viewers. Mouse reporting is now enabled while gg runs
  (shift+drag for native terminal text selection).

#### Performance log
- Global `--time-track <file>` flag (TUI + every CLI command): appends one
  redacted JSON span per process start, git subprocess, and engine operation.
  Same span schema as `gg inspect --trace` and the panic dump. Embedded
  using-gg agent skill v4.

#### Truncation tooltip
- TUI: when the focused panel's selected row is too wide and ellipsized, a
  floating strip directly above the row shows its full text (all four list
  panels; wraps up to 3 lines; suppressed under modals/popups).

#### Worktree for an existing branch
- `w` on the Branches panel now creates a worktree that checks out the
  **selected existing branch** (no new branch); `W` opens the previous
  template-driven popup (new branch + worktree). CLI:
  `gg worktree add --branch <name>`. Embedded using-gg agent skill v3.

#### Branch management
- Branch management: `b` (create-branch popup) / `B` (create and smart-switch)
  / `d` (delete with confirm + unmerged force fork) on the TUI Branches panel,
  and `gg branch create <name> [<start>]` / `gg branch delete [--force] <name>`
  in the CLI. The embedded using-gg agent skill is now v2.

#### E2E harness
- **E2E scenario harness** (`e2e/`): declarative TOML scenarios build real git
  repos (optionally served over real HTTP via `git http-backend`), run gg CLI
  commands in-process, and assert user-visible state — files, branches, stashes
  and their content, sync state, history shape. 17 scenarios cover SmartSwitch,
  SmartPull (ff/rebase/merge/abort/conflict/background/worktree), stash,
  commit+push, undo, and worktree add/remove. New agent skill:
  `.claude/skills/writing-e2e-scenarios/`.
- 8 more scenarios (s18–s25) covering `gg branch create/delete` (start points,
  guards, the unmerged fork with and without `--force`) and
  `gg worktree add --branch` (existing-branch checkout, guards, usage errors);
  the skill's contract table gained the three new command rows.
- **Fix** `gg worktree remove <relative-path>`: a repo-top-relative path now
  matches regardless of process cwd (found by the e2e corpus; matters for
  in-process frontends like the future MCP server).
- **Staged test runner** `./test.sh` / `test.cmd`: quality gates (vet+gofmt)
  → unit tests → e2e scenarios last; `race` target for the pre-merge gate,
  `unit`/`e2e` to run one stage.

#### Foundation & engine (M1)
- Frontend-agnostic core **engine**: the `Operation` contract with a streamed
  `Event` union (`Progress`/`GitLine`/`DecisionNeeded`/`Timing`/`Done`) and a
  `Decider` for mid-flight, option-list-only forks.
- Thin git verb layer (`internal/git`) over a `gitcmd` argv builder and a
  `gitexec` process runner (with a `FakeRunner` for tests).
- Smart operations: `SmartPull` (worktree-aware divergence decision tree),
  `SmartSwitch` (auto-stash/restore), `Commit`, `Push`, `Stash`, and a
  ref-only `UndoLastCommit`.
- Observability: span ring buffer, tracing, redaction, and a panic debug dump
  (`gg inspect`, `--debug-dump`, `--trace`).
- Interactive **TUI** (Bubble Tea): size-aware multi-panel layout, a modal
  Decider, and a panic-safe dump on crash.

#### CLI (M2)
- Scriptable commands: `gg status`, `commit`, `pull` (`--background`,
  `--on-conflict`), `push`, `switch`, `stash`, `undo`.
- Forks resolved by flags, an interactive stdin prompt, or a clear error when
  neither is available; unknown-subcommand guard.

#### Worktree management (M2)
- TOML config (`.gg.toml`) with field-level overlay and worktree branch/path
  **templates** (`<parent-branch>`, `<repo>`, `<date:…>`, `<seq:…>`, `<user:…>`);
  per-repo `<seq>` counters in `<git-common-dir>/gg/state.toml`.
- **Create**: TUI `w` create popup (live preview, editable name) and `W`
  create-and-switch; `gg worktree add [<start-point>]`; shared resolution in
  `internal/worktree`.
- **Switch**: `enter` on the Worktrees panel re-roots the TUI into the selected
  worktree; `gg shell-init [bash|zsh|fish]` follows the switch with a real `cd`
  via `--cwd-file`.
- **Delete**: TUI `d` on the Worktrees panel and
  `gg worktree remove [--with-branch] [--force] <path>`. Reactive-force model —
  choose worktree-only vs. worktree+branch up front, then force is offered only
  when git refuses (dirty tree or unmerged branch). Engine guards refuse
  removing the current or primary worktree.

#### TUI list UX
- `shift+tab` cycles panel focus backwards; `pgup`/`pgdn` move the selection by
  25% of the focused panel's viewport.
- `o` cycles a panel's sort order (`default → name ↑/↓ → date ↑/↓`) — each
  panel defines its own name/date semantics (branches: committer date;
  worktrees: HEAD commit date; status files: mtime; commits: commit time).
  Branches default to newest-first.
- `/` filters any list panel by case-insensitive substring (`enter` keeps the
  filter, `esc` clears it); selection, paging, and all action keys operate on
  the filtered, sorted view.

#### Repo switcher
- gg auto-records every repository it opens in a machine-local MRU registry
  (`~/.local/state/gg/repos.toml`); dead paths are pruned automatically.
- TUI: `R` opens a switcher popup — filter as you type, `enter` re-roots into
  the chosen repo (the shell follows via `--cwd-file`), `ctrl+d` forgets an
  entry.
- CLI: `gg repo list` and `gg repo switch <query>` (unique substring match
  prints the path and writes `--cwd-file` so a wrapped shell `cd`s there).

#### Agent init
- `gg init` detects installed AI coding agents (Claude Code, Junie, Codex,
  OpenCode, Cursor, AGENTS.md, …) and installs an embedded "using-gg" skill
  teaching them to drive git through the gg CLI. Already-installed targets are
  checked by default (applying refreshes them); new agents are explicit
  opt-in. `--all`, `--update`, `--agents <ids>`, `--list` for scripting.
- TUI: `,` opens a Settings popup with the same agent-skill picker.
- The skill ships inside the gg binary (version-marked); installed copies
  change only when a newer binary's init runs.

#### Developer tooling
- Project skills in `.claude/skills/`: `adding-features` (engine→TUI→CLI wiring
  checklist for new operations/commands) and `adding-tui-windows` (panel vs
  popup vs modal taxonomy and wiring), both validated against baseline runs.
